# About me
I love watching the world around me burning and being consumed by the flames myself as well. Don't try to save me though - I will just pull you along.

# Learning curve
In 2017 I've started coding in Python and learning Blender. Eventually I got to the point of [forking someone else's](https://github.com/Shararamosh/JiggleArmature) and [making my own](https://github.com/Shararamosh/gfbanm_importer) Blender addon using Python API.

Around 2018 I also got interested in 2 other things:
1. **A Hat in Time** modding scene.

Since September 2018 I've been making A Hat in Time mods that I publish on [my Steam Workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198063502902/myworkshopfiles/?appid=253230) and keep releasing new and updating older ones. I make mods using modified Unreal Development Kit called A Hat in Time Modding Tools (for importing, creating and previewing assets) and UnrealScript language (for writing scripts).

2. **Game Boy Pok√©mon** rom-hacking scene.

Around January 2018 I've started learning [RGBDS](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/) with [Pok√©mon Red and Blue disassembly project](https://github.com/pret/pokered) and eventually created my first rom-hack titled **Pok√©mon Bigger** and **Pok√©mon Longer**. The names had a double meaning - one is a reference to this rom-hack having absurdly large amount of custom text added and second one being the names of KFC burgers. Because I still respect GitHub people, I am not publishing this rom-hack here (it's very much cringe, that's all). However some time later I've started my another rom-hack - [Pok√©mon Red and Blue Russian Version](https://github.com/Shararamosh/pokered-ru). The first public version took a very long to get released - I've restarted this project from scratch twice and each time it was happening due to a technical roadblock. Eventually they all got resolved and I've started releasing regular patches for localizing the original game ROM files.

# Current time
I'm currently working on Blender addon for importing and exporting assets (meshes and animations for now) from Nintendo Switch Pok√©mon games in collaboration with [ChicoEevee](https://github.com/ChicoEevee).

Expect great things.
