I love watching the world around me burning and being consumed by the flames myself as well.

I mostly code in Python and UnrealScript ([A Hat in Time](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198063502902/myworkshopfiles/?appid=253230)) and also a bit in Z80 Assembly ([Pok√©mon Red and Blue Russian Version](https://github.com/Shararamosh/pokered-ru)).

Expect great things.
